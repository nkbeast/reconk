**RECONK** is a powerful, cross-platform desktop application that provides a graphical user interface for complex web reconnaissance workflows. It automates and simplifies the process of intelligence gathering by orchestrating a suite of powerful command-line tools, presenting their output in a clean, real-time terminal view.

Built for security researchers and penetration testers, Reconk streamlines everything from initial subdomain enumeration to in-depth vulnerability scanning. It manages workspaces, scopes, and scan outputs, allowing you to focus on analysis rather than manual tool chaining.

**Disclaimer:** Usage of Reconk for attacking targets without prior consent is illegal. It is the end user's responsibility to obey all applicable local, state, and federal laws. The developers assume no liability and are not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by this program. Use responsibly.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Native GUI:** A fast and responsive desktop interface for Linux, built with Rust and Tauri.
* **Automated Workflow:** Orchestrates a full recon pipeline, from subdomain discovery to vulnerability analysis.
* **Real-time Terminal View:** Streams live, colorized output from all underlying tools directly into the UI.
* **Modular Scanning:** Separate modules for reconnaissance, JavaScript analysis, parameter discovery, permutation scanning, and more.
* **Workspace Management:** Automatically creates and organizes output files for each target.
* **Self-Contained Installation:** Packaged as a simple `.deb` file with dependencies handled by the system's package manager.

## üó∫Ô∏è Workflow Mindmap

Reconk follows a structured approach to reconnaissance, allowing you to progressively build a comprehensive picture of your target.

![Workflow Mindmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nkbeast/reconk/main/assets/workflow.png)

1.  **Define Target:** Create a new workspace for your target (e.g., `example.com`).
2.  **Set Scope:** Provide a list of root domains for enumeration.
3.  **Initial Recon:** Run the main recon module to discover subdomains and live hosts.
4.  **Deep Scans:** Use the output from the initial recon to run more specific modules:
    * Vulnerability Scanning (Nuclei)
    * JavaScript Analysis (Katana, HTTPX)
    * Parameter Discovery
    * Domain Permutation Scanning (Gotator)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Dependencies

Reconk acts as a graphical frontend for some of the best open-source security tools available.

* **Framework:** [**Tauri (Rust)**](https://tauri.app/) - For the cross-platform desktop application shell.
* **Backend Server:** [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) with [**FastAPI**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) - For handling scan logic and process management.
* **Core Dependencies:** The `.deb` package will automatically install the following tools and libraries:
    * **Subdomain Enumeration:** [Subfinder](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder)
    * **Web Probing:** [HTTPX](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx)
    * **Web Crawling:** [Katana](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/katana)
    * **Vulnerability Scanning:** [Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei)
    * **DNS Permutations:** [Gotator](https://github.com/Josue87/gotator)
    * **DNS Resolution:** [puredns](https://github.com/d3mondev/puredns)
    * **And more...**

## üíø Installation

The easiest way to install Reconk on Debian-based systems (like Kali, Parrot OS, Ubuntu) is with the `.deb` package.

1.  **Download the Latest Release:**
    * Go to the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/nkbeast/reconk/releases/latest) and download the `.deb` file (e.g., `reconk-1.5.0_amd64.deb`).

2.  **Install the Package:**
    Open a terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    sudo dpkg -i reconk-1.5.0_amd64.deb
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    If `dpkg` reports any missing dependencies, run this command to automatically find and install them:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -f
    ```
    This will install all the required command-line tools and libraries.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

1.  After installation, find **Reconk** in your system's application menu and launch it. A launcher icon will also be placed on your desktop.
2.  Enter a target name (e.g., `example.com`) to create a new workspace.
3.  Provide a list of root domains to define the initial scope for enumeration.
4.  After the initial scan, navigate back to the dashboard to run more advanced modules like JavaScript scanning, vulnerability scanning, etc.
5.  View the real-time output in the terminal window for each scan. All results are saved to `~/reconk/<target_name>/`.
